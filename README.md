# My Path Studing Golang

## My Approach 
Go is not my first language so i decided to take diffrent approach to learning go and avoid mistakes I made with other languages.
- I do not follow tutorials unless I get stack and can't find solution in documentation. After I unstack I immediately drop tutorial and get back to coding
- I do not use LLMs for code generation. I've used ai only to brainstorm ideas or make sure I understand concepts

**Reason for avoiding both generated code and tutorial is similar - by using LLM or tutorials I tend to turn off critical thinking and basically I outsource learning nad thinking. 
Which might be good for short term but really damaging for long term career.**

## Projects 
Most projects here are just demos, because I used them just to explore technologies or to better understand how to work with them.
I try now to use this knowledge, for something bigger and actually finish it, for example here:

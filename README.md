# My Path Studing Golang

## My Approach 
Go is not my first language so i decided to take diffrent approach to learning go and avoid mistakes I made with other languages.
- I do not follow tutorials unless I get stack and can't find solution in documentation. After I unstack I immediately drop tutorial and get back to coding
- I do not use LLMs for code generation. I've used ai only to brainstorm ideas or make sure I understand concepts

**Reason for avoiding both generated code and tutorial is similar - by using LLM or tutorials I tend to turn off critical thinking and basically I outsource learning nad thinking. 
Which might be good for short term but really damaging for long term career.**

## Techonologies explored 
- Go
  - gin
  - gorilla
- Sql
  - Sqlite
  - Postgres
- AWS
  - AWS Lambda
  - API Gateway
  - EventBrige
  - S3
  - ECR
- Docker
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Projects 
Most projects here are just demos, because I used them just to explore technologies or to better understand how to work with them.
I try now to use this knowledge, for something bigger and actually finish it, for example here:

### <a href="https://github.com/PawelHarasiuk/GoStudy/tree/main/GoCrawler">GoCrawler</a>
- After learning basic syntax in TourOfGo I wanted to write code so I jumped into recreating things from my collage. So this is basic web crawler I've done in C# previously. It enters website and looks for all emails on page.
### UniSys
- 
  Again exercise from my C# course in collage. Program takes csv as an input, clean it and return in json format. It helped me play around with files and become more confident with syntax.

### Form

### LambdaTest
- I started learning AWS Lambda, additionally I started learning docker and now it is pretty natural for me similar to git
### ConnectToS3
- I've learned reading and writing to file stored on aws S3
### StaticWebsite
- I wanted to test hosting static website on aws S3 for my other project. Additionally i managed to send request from HTML and javascript to aws lambda go backend, and communicate between those two. PS turned out I did not care about CORS because aws allows seemless communication between lambda and S3
